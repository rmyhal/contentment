Are you fed up with progress indicators that run for 159 milliseconds and then disappears and are a real pain in the neck for both you and your customers?
`Contentment` effectively manages frustrating progress indicators, enhancing the user experience.
```kotlin
Contentment {
  when (uiState) {
    is Loading -> indicator { CircularProgressIndicator() }
    is Loaded -> content { ScreenContent(uiState) }
  }
}
```

## Usage

```groovy
implementation "me.rmyhal.contentment:contentment:<version>"
```

The library handles content loading with customizable behavior for showing loading indicators.
Allows specifying minimum display time and delay before showing the loading indicator.
* If the content finishes loading before the `delayMillis` threshold, the `indicator {}` will not be shown.
* If the content loading exceeds the `delayMillis` threshold, the `indicator {}` will be displayed, 
and `content {}` will appear only after the `minShowTimeMillis` duration has passed. 

If you screen is built with a sealed UI state. 
```kotlin
@Composable
fun Screen(viewModel: ViewModel) {
  val uiState by viewModel.uiState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
  ScreenContent(uiState)
}

@Composable
fun ScreenContent(uiState: UiState) {
  Contentment(
    minShowTimeMillis = 700L,
    delayMillis = 500L
  ) {
    when (uiState) {
      is Loading -> indicator { CircularProgressIndicator() }
      is Loaded -> content { ScreenContent(uiState) }
    }
  }  
}
```

Apart from that, the library provides a Jetpack Compose adaptation of the native [ContentLoadingProgressBar](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/widget/ContentLoadingProgressBar).

```kotlin
var loading = remember { mutableStateOf(true) }
ContentLoadingIndicator(
  loading = loading,
) {
  CircularProgressIndicator()
}
```
